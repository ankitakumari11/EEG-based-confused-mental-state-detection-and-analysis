The state of confusion while learning can reduce the performance student in studies.  Monitoring the engagement of students in the online courses is a tedious job. This paper aims to detect the confusion state among students watching MOOC videos based on eeg  signals. EEG (Electroencephalography) signals are the brain’s electrical signals that can be used to detect the activities like engagement, happiness, stress and many other emotions.  Machine learning is an easy and efficient method to deal with the complex eeg data and analyze it  . The dataset used is the combination of two datasets from Kaggle. First one is EEG data recorded from 10 students and the other consists of demographic information of the students. Various machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting, decision tree, random forest, knn, naïve bayes are used to classify the data as confused or not confused.Decision tree classifier proved to be best algorithms for classification from the comparative analysis of all the implemented algorithms.
